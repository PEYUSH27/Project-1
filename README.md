Gold Price Forecasting 

Business Objective:

The data alloted is related to gold prices. The goal is to understand the underlying structure in the dataset and come up with a suitable forecasting model which can effectively forecast gold prices for next 30 days.

This forecast model will be used by gold exporting and gold importing companies to understand the commodity price movements and accordingly set their revenue expectations.
